## Prerequisites

- Request  üì∏`CAMERA` and üìÇ`STORAGE` permissions. Read more [Android Permissions](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/permissions/overview)

## Setup

Add it in your root `build.gradle` at the end of repositories:

```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        //...omitted for brevity
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```



Add the dependency

```groovy
	dependencies {
	        implementation "com.github.kojofosu:Queue-R:$latest_release"
	}
```



## Usage
Sample implementation [here](app/)
```xml
    <com.mcdev.queuer.ScanView
        android:id="@+id/queuer_view"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        app:setFlashIconOverlay="true"/>

```

- Initialize your scan view
```kotlin
        private lateinit var scanView: ScanView
        scanView = findViewById<ScanView>(R.id.scan_view)
```

- Create your barcode detector
```kotlin
        val detector: BarcodeDetector = BarcodeDetector.Builder(this)
            .setBarcodeFormats(Barcode.QR_CODE)
            .build()
```

- Create your camera source
```kotlin
        val cameraSource =  CameraSource.Builder(this, detector)
            .setRequestedFps(25f)
            .setAutoFocusEnabled(true)
	    .build()
```

- Then start the scanner. 
	`Note`: Camera permission is required
```kotlin
	scanView.startScan(detector, camerasource)	//TODO camera permission is required.
```
